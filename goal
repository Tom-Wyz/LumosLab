The goal is to design and build open source easy to build stage lights to help low budget theatre and film productions get industry standard lighting for a fraction of the cost and that they can repair without relaying on the manufacturer. Another benefit would be that like with most open source projects is that features won't be developed and then locked behind artificial price brackets that keep schools and other low budget productions from buying equipment. I already have a prototype of a 7 RGBAW led parcan that can be 3d printed and made with off the shelf components and I am in the final steps of the electronic design for it
